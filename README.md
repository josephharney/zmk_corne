# zmk_corne
custom ZMK configuration for 36 key corne keyboard


Starting with configration from https://peppe.rs/posts/programming_on_34_keys/

Changing from Colemak to Colemak DH(m).


# TODO
- [X] Update build.yaml to use the corne 5 column keyboard (look at the typeractive.xyz github for their build.yml settings)

- [ ] Setup github actions to build the firmware.

- [ ] Switch the base layer from colemak to colemak dh(m)

- [ ] re-map thumb keys to match the advantage 360

- [ ] Figure out what to do with the extra thumb keys

- [ ] update nav layer to use arrow keys in inverted T

- [ ] remap sym layer to match standard keyboard since  I do not care about the vim shortcuts

- [ ] Add + - numpad enter to the num layer

- [ ] remap home-row mods to match the layout suggested for macos in https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods (CAGS)

- [ ] Look into tap downs or hold downs for keyboard shortcuts

- [ ] think about using the meh key for fancy macros and custom keyboard shortcuts.
